	<h1><b>Hello! This is my very first website I am working on. It's fun writing out the codes and learning how to.</b></h1>
	<p>This is a friendly reminder that if you are having a bad day or aren't in the mood, be sure to check in with your loved ones. Talk to them, try to make jokes, watch movies/seris together, play games, or do anything that makes you happy and smile. You are not alone! There are people out thee who would love to get to know you and be your friend. So, what are you waiting for? Go make some friends and start a new journey that'll take you places. Don't forget to smile.</p>
